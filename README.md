# Glissile

Glissile is a very basic, glam-compatible fixed-point math library. It supports a number type,
vector types, specifying the number of bits for the fractional part, and conversions between
floating-point numbers, `glam` vectors and some `bevy` types.

## Caveats

Currently, the operations are limited based on my own use case, so full compatibility with `glam` isn't there yet.
Also missing examples and documentation.
